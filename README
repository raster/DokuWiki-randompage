I wanted to use the Random Page plugin for DokuWiki:

http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:random_page

But it didn't work.

So I poked at it a bit... and now it works.

(I even fixed the URLs it returns.)

Jean Marc Massou did all the original code, I just cleaned it up so it would work.

I did email him about it, but I figured I should also publish the code in case someone else wanted to use it.

I also changed it from being named 'random_page' to 'randompage' 

(Hooray for open source.)

This code is released under the GPL.
