# dokuwiki randompage

My goal is to have the same function as MediaWiki's Random Page.

I use the search functions to have an array of files and output a random page of this array.

## Usage

```
?do=randompage
```

or

```
?do=nsrandompage
```

For exampleï¼š`http://localhost:8800/doku.php?do=randompage`

>I did email him about it, but I figured I should also publish the code in case someone else wanted to use it. I also changed it from being named 'random_page' to 'randompage'
